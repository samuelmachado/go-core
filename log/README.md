# Log
This package sets a standard for using logs. In the future, we will implement the automatic retrieval of the requestID through tracing, thus making it transparent for the dev


## Installation

```go
go get github.com/samuelmachado/go-core/log
```

## Usage

See [examples](zap_example_test.go) documentation.
